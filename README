Parrots for Citizens 2 by aufdemrand

Parrots can be just for fun, or be used with questing to hold clues, and are
meant to be used on Chicken NPCs, though could technically be any kind.
Enderdragon parrots, anybody? (Joking! Probably not a good idea!)

Parrots randomly store messages said in the local area and repeat them back.
Parrots can also be fed a clue, information that it keeps and blurts out with 
the normal chatter it has heard.


Features:

Parrots hold 5 messages automatically by listening to surrounding chatter.
Parrots hold 1 message fed by the parrot owner.


Commands:

/parrot clue       # changes the clue
